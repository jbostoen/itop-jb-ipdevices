Need assistance with iTop or one of its extensions?  
Need custom development?  
Please get in touch to discuss the terms: **jbostoen.itop@outlook.com**

## What?
This contains a number of new classes.

* **IPDevice**: abstract class, parent for various subclasses of IP Devices.
* **IPCamera**: a more specific kind of IP Device
* **IPDeviceGeneric**: generic class for all sorts of devices. Examples: smart home and home automation systems, HVAC, sensors, ...
* **IPPhone**: the most interesting one, because iTop already has an IP Phone. In my humble opinion, it's totally wrong in Combodo's data model. The IP Phone is seen as a phone, instead of a network device ( ConnectableCI ). At my employer, the phones are also switches - they're in between the PC and a regular switch. 

‚ö† Careful: this extension completely redefines the original iTop IPPhone class.
Make sure you don't have IP Phones as defined by the default iTop data model; data may get lost!

This extension is not recommended for beginners. For them, I recommend listing your IPPhones as NetworkDevice instead and give it their own type.

## TeemIP add-on
* If Combodo's TeemIP extension is installed, this extension will be adjusted (see subfolder jb-ipdevices-teemip)
