Need assistance with iTop or one of its extensions?  
Need custom development?  
Please get in touch to discuss the terms: **jbostoen.itop@outlook.com**

## What?
This contains a number of new classes.

* **IPDevice**: abstract class, parent for various subclasses of IP Devices.
* **IPCamera**: a more specific kind of IP Device
* **IPDeviceGeneric**: generic class for all sorts of devices. Examples: smart home and home automation systems, HVAC, sensors, ...
* **IPPhone**: the most interesting one, because iTop already has an IP Phone. In my humble opinion, it's totally wrong in Combodo's data model. The IP Phone is seen as a phone, instead of a network device ( ConnectableCI ). At my employer, the phones are also switches - they're in between the PC and a regular switch. 

‚ö† Danger: this extension completely redefines the original iTop IPPhone class.  
Make sure you don't have IP Phones as defined by the default iTop data model; data may get lost!

This extension is not recommended for beginners.  
For beginners, I recommend listing your IPPhones as NetworkDevice instead and add "IP Phone" as a network type typology.


## TeemIP add-on

* By default additional work is included. If Combodo's TeemIP extension is installed, this extension will adapt itself.
